## Part 1: Diving into HTML/CSS and JavaScript (45 minutes)
**Objective:** Introduce participants to the building blocks of web development through a hands-on project of building a Wikipedia page. Participants will learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, and get a small taste of JavaScript. The goal is for everyone to understand how these elements work together to create websites.

**Details:**
- **HTML Basics** (15 minutes): Introduction to HTML structure (elements, tags, attributes), creating a simple page (headings, paragraphs, links, images).
- **CSS 101** (15 minutes): Basics of CSS (selectors, properties, values), styling our HTML page, introducing the box model, and playing with colors and fonts.
- **Jumping into JavaScript** (15 minutes): Brief intro to JavaScript, variables, functions, and DOM manipulation. Participants will add a simple interactive feature to their Wikipedia page (e.g., a button that changes text).

## Part 2: Bootstrap Magic (20 minutes)
**Objective:** Introduce Bootstrap as a powerful tool to make web development faster and easier. Participants will learn how to use Bootstrap's grid system and components to design responsive websites.

**Details:**
- **Introduction to Bootstrap** (5 minutes): What is Bootstrap and why use it? Overview of Bootstrap's grid system and responsive design principles.
- **Using Bootstrap Components** (15 minutes): Hands-on with Bootstrap components (navigation bars, cards, forms). Quick exercise to integrate some Bootstrap components into the previously created Wikipedia page.

## Part 3: Git Going with Git and GitHub (10 minutes)
**Objective:** Familiarize participants with Git for version control and GitHub for code sharing. Teach the basics of cloning a repository with a Bootstrap template for a website to showcase an app.

**Details:**
- **Git Basics** (5 minutes): Introduction to version control, why Git is awesome, basic Git commands (init, add, commit, push).
- **Cloning with GitHub** (5 minutes): Creating a GitHub account (if needed), cloning a Bootstrap app template repository to local machine for the next exercise.

## Part 4: Editing and Deploying the App Template (15 minutes)
**Objective:** Apply what weâ€™ve learned by editing the Bootstrap template and deploying it using GitHub Pages. This section aims to empower participants with the ability to make a website showcasing the details of the app or product they end up making for their hackathon.

**Details:**
- **Customizing the App Template** (10 minutes): Quick walkthrough on how to modify the cloned Bootstrap template (changing text, images, and adding a new section).
- **Deploying the App** (5 minutes): Introduction to deployment options (GitHub Pages), deploying the customized app so participants can share their work with the world.

## Wrap-Up and Q&A
**Objective:** Conclude the workshop with a summary of what was covered. Open the floor for any questions, encouraging participants to share their thoughts and seek clarification on any concepts.

### Getting Started

Let's make sure you have the necessary tools and resources to get started.

#### Step 1: Take the Survey

Please take a moment to fill out this survey to help me understand your current skill level and goals for this workshop: [Survey Link](https://forms.gle/RxA7BoVPGxNffY2R6).

#### Step 2: Download Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Download Visual Studio Code (VSCode) from the official website: [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
If you prefer to use another Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for web development, feel free to use whichever tool you're comfortable with. Just make sure it supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development.

#### Step 3: Install Extensions (Optional)

If you're using Visual Studio Code, I recommend installing the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey. This extension allows you to launch a local development server with live reload capability, making it easier to preview your web pages as you code.

To install the "Live Server" extension:
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "Live Server" in the extensions marketplace.
4. Click on the "Install" button next to the "Live Server" extension.

### Lesson 1: Terminal/Command Line

#### What is the Terminal/Command Line?

The terminal, also known as the command line or shell, is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer's operating system. It allows you to execute commands to perform various tasks such as navigating through directories, managing files, and running programs.

#### Windows Instructions:

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter.

2. **Navigate to a Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command followed by the path of the directory you want to navigate to.
     ```
     cd path\to\directory
     ```

3. **Create a New Directory**:
   - Use the `mkdir` command followed by the name of the new directory.
     ```
     mkdir new_directory
     ```

4. **Create a File**:
   - Use the `type nul >` command followed by the name of the file you want to create.
     ```
     type nul > wiki.html
     ```

#### Mac Instructions:

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight Search.
   - Type `Terminal` and press Enter.

2. **Navigate to a Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command followed by the path of the directory you want to navigate to.
     ```
     cd /path/to/directory
     ```

3. **Create a New Directory**:
   - Use the `mkdir` command followed by the name of the new directory.
     ```
     mkdir new_directory
     ```

4. **Create a File**:
   - Use the `touch` command followed by the name of the file you want to create.
     ```
     touch wiki.html
     ```

These commands will help you navigate through directories, create new directories, and create files in the terminal/command line interface on both Windows and Mac operating systems.


### Recommendation: GitBash for Windows Users

If you're using Windows and prefer a Unix-like command line experience, I highly recommend using GitBash. GitBash provides a lightweight and powerful terminal emulator that includes Git for version control along with a Unix-like command line experience.

#### Why GitBash?

1. **Unix-Like Environment**: GitBash provides a Unix-like command line interface, which is more familiar to me as a developer accustomed to working with Linux or macOS.

2. **Git Integration**: GitBash comes bundled with Git, allowing me to perform version control tasks directly from the command line without needing to install additional software.

3. **Enhanced Productivity**: With GitBash, I can leverage powerful Unix commands and scripting capabilities to streamline my development workflow and automate repetitive tasks.

4. **Compatibility**: GitBash ensures compatibility with many Unix-based development tools and utilities, making it easier for me to collaborate with teams using different operating systems.

#### How to Install GitBash:

1. **Download Git for Windows**: I can visit the official Git website and download the Git for Windows installer: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

2. **Run the Installer**: After downloading the installer, I can double-click the file and follow the on-screen instructions to install GitBash on my system.

3. **Launch GitBash**: Once installed, I can launch GitBash from the Start menu or by searching for "Git Bash" in the Windows search bar.

4. **Customize Settings (Optional)**: I have the option to customize GitBash settings such as font size, color scheme, and default shell preferences to suit my preferences.

By using GitBash, I'll have access to a powerful and versatile command line environment tailored for web development on the Windows platform.
